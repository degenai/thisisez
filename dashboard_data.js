A palpable rotation from risk-on degeneracy to bunker-mentality is underway, with anons fleeing the \"scam\" of crabbing crypto markets and the perceived \"AI bubble\" in favor of physical silver stacks, even as cultists cling to the wreckage of GME and BBBYQ with religious delusion. The discourse has devolved into a toxic feedback loop of misogynistic scapegoating and tribal warfare\u2014particularly the bitter ETH vs. SOL feuds\u2014masking a deep-seated terror that institutional \"whales\" and central planners have finally rigged the game beyond repair. Ultimately, the vibe is one of high-schizo cynicism: the \"Great Reset\" looms, the charts are painted by algorithms, and the only solace is found in preparing for the inevitable collapse of the fiat Ponzi.",

Like \"Hey, honey, look at WTF this guy was thinking of adding a 'great room' with a VIEW and 2nd kitchen and guest bath! Nice idea, would've never occurred to me.\"",

I'm hated because I know my worth, I know I'm needed there more than they need me and I shut down any extra work they wanna put on me just because I actually do my job. I'm not gonna allow myself to get punished for not being a lazy bastard. The only reason I even applied there was for my parents to shut up about me not having a job even tho I was paying them rent with my savings. Firing me would actually be a good thing for me so I'm in a win/win situation. I've saved up more now that I've been forced to work so if I get fired or quit I'll have another year or so worth of money to pay rent and bills without needing a job",

Like \"Hey, honey, look at WTF this guy was thinking of adding a 'great room' with a VIEW and 2nd kitchen and guest bath! Nice idea, would've never occurred to me.\"",
