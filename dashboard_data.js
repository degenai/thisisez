Never has an investor married their bags to the point of obsession and building their identities around their investment more than stinkies. It\u2019s almost a unique case of Stockholm syndrome mixed with schizophrenia. When you bring up topics to stinkies such as \u201cbull run\u201d \u201ccrypto market\u201d etc their mind goes blank, they don\u2019t even process what you are saying. In their minds there is one thing and one thing only; Link and Sergei. Their warped minds will come up with endless grandiose scenarios to maintain their illusion that they are genius investors who are smarter than everyone else. They simultaneously hate and stick their noses up to normies, but also expect those same Normies to pump their bags and do all the work for them of making them finally make it.

Meanwhile, central banks all around the world are dumping US treasuries, including the famous Yen carry trade now being over, which helped fund US government deficit operation. Basically, the United States government is insolvent because it spends more than it collects in taxes, and there's not enough buyers for their debt.

This basically means they're going to be adding a LOT of zeroes to their balance sheet, which is another way of saying they're printing trillions of more dollar shitcoins, which will dilute the dollar even more, and make assets more expensive. Meanwhile, central banks all around the world are dumping US treasuries, including the famous Yen carry trade now being over, which helped fund US government deficit operation. Basically, the United States government is insolvent because it spends more than it collects in taxes, and there's not enough buyers for their debt.
