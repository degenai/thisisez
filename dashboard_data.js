Monetary technologies are complex and path-dependent, but they still follow diffusion curves. Gold, banknotes, checks, cards, electronic banking and the internet all had to fight entrenched systems, regulation, and incumbents. None of that stopped them from tracing out a logistic adoption path: slow fringe phase to rapid inflection once infrastructure and trust reach critical mass leads to maturity. Bitcoin does not have to \u201cflip a switch and replace the whole system\u201d to be on that curve.
