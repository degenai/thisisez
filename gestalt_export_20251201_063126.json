Matches the highest tier wagies - doctors, FAANG, directors.\n3. It's enough to retire immediately. In fact, 5 mil is, so it's enough to retire, 10 is enough to retire with some luxuries.\n4. Perhaps the key - 10 mill is not \"achievable\". 3-5 mil maybe is - work the right job, save, invest, get lucky a few times, start a small biz. 10 is beyond what most even dream about.\nOn the other hand, 10 mil is not enough to throw money around or buy what people think about as true luxuries - no yachts, private flights (reasonably), islands, starting businesses without dedicating life to them, etc.",
