Homes that were built recently (past ten years) are cookie cutter plywood carvings. And the homes before then are mostly lemon houses. I&#039;m in the housing market for a while now, I speak to many people about what&#039;s going on. Basically a few mega corps bought into land, then homes, then farmland. Probably preparing for what is to come. But they did it all on credit, and at and alarming 2 or more trillion of debt. How many decades have they operated on that fiat fantasy? 2008 was literally nothing. All they did was put a 2x2 bandaid on an amputee&#039;s freshly cut stump and now the market is just a rotting corpse. I hear people on the news now saying housing is doing great. That&#039;s how you know it&#039;s bad. Thank God I sold my home in Santa Monica CA when I did last year. With it I intend to purchase three modest sized homes and rent them for only a few hundred dollar profit a month after this all crashes. This way I can help families save money and get them off the blackrock debt train who charge something like 1.2k extra a month that they literally don&#039;t need to.\n\nFor all of you would-be landlords remember this.
