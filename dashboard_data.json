Silver will indeed go up but as it does society will degrade and that's something us stackers have also been preparing for in parallel to silver. Any number of things can go wrong, and some will. But many of those problems involve people who want your shit. Having plenty of ammunition makes would-be thieves use their brains. Whether that means thinking twice or splattered on a wall depends on how much ammunition you have.\n\n>>If you don\u2019t have a community, a gun is almost worthless\nSo wrong on so many levels.

Homes that were built recently (past ten years) are cookie cutter plywood carvings. And the homes before then are mostly lemon houses. I&#039;m in the housing market for a while now, I speak to many people about what&#039;s going on. Basically a few mega corps bought into land, then homes, then farmland. Probably preparing for what is to come. But they did it all on credit, and at and alarming 2 or more trillion of debt. How many decades have they operated on that fiat fantasy? 2008 was literally nothing. All they did was put a 2x2 bandaid on an amputee&#039;s freshly cut stump and now the market is just a rotting corpse. I hear people on the news now saying housing is doing great. That&#039;s how you know it&#039;s bad. Thank God I sold my home in Santa Monica CA when I did last year. With it I intend to purchase three modest sized homes and rent them for only a few hundred dollar profit a month after this all crashes. This way I can help families save money and get them off the blackrock debt train who charge something like 1.2k extra a month that they literally don&#039;t need to.\n\nFor all of you would-be landlords remember this. Humble yourself or you will be humbled. This fiat system is going down to Chinatown literally and figuratively speaking. You bet your ass that bad landlords will have a rude awakening. Remember your humility if you are graced enough to be in my position.",
