Should I just put that 5k into silver right now and trade it in for guns and ammo 3 months from now? Or should I just keep the fiat money sitting idly in my savings?\n\n>>61413208\nListen anon, this isn't financial advice. But if it were me I would buy a decent firearm with a good amount if ammunition and then worry about stacking silver with what's left. Silver will indeed go up but as it does society will degrade and that's something us stackers have also been preparing for in parallel to silver. Any number of things can go wrong, and some will. But many of those problems involve people who want your shit. Having plenty of ammunition makes would-be thieves use their brains. Whether that means thinking twice or splattered on a wall depends on how much ammunition you have.",

Imagine someone over the age of 23 and speaking English doing shit like that as a real ass job LMAO.\n\nThe nutty thing to me is how much the cost of a shitty commute is to a poorly paid wagie. Wagie has got a very financed shit mobile slurping up gas, the wagie is loaded up with some diabetes sugar coffee milkshake and some processed breakfast snack that cost an hour's wage. The wagie is dressed in some shitty ass \"business casual\" clothes which it had to buy and also look like ass in as a humiliation ritual. \nThe wagie will spend another hour plus wages on bowl slop and another quarter hour on other bubbly drinks. \nAll that to be able to afford a shitty shared room in an apartment to play vidya for a few hours before collapsing to do again",
