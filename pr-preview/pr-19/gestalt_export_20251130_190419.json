I used to write automotive rating software, and we looked at a shitton of things in coming up with the risk factor, and insurance gaps by themselves weren't one. Getting a ticket during an insurance gap definitely was a factor, as was getting a ticket during a registration lapse - because those demonstrate a lack of judgement, but the insurance gap by itself isn't one. The biggest factors in your risk score by far (even more than ticket/accident history) are your credit score and automobile class (e.g. sports car), because your present credit score is significantly more correlated with your future accident rate than your driving history is, and most people that buy a sports car aren't doing so in order to cruise slowly around the local mall. The replacement cost of the insurance vehicle obviously plays a part in your insurance cost, but that's not part of the risk factor, it's multiplied by the risk factor as part of the final calculation to get the cost of insurance.",
