You take that money and buy magic beans that keep growing bigger and more valuable. When 5 years pass, those magic beans are now worth $40. You sell a tiny piece of them to pay back the $10, and you keep $30 as pure profit. The key trick: He's borrowing money at 0% interest (free money!) and using it to buy Bitcoin, betting that Bitcoin will go up so much in value that when he has to pay people back, it's no big deal - he'll have made way more profit. Why people give him free money: They're giving him 0% loans (convertible bonds) because they hope to convert that loan into MicroStrategy stock later if the stock price goes up.
