I have $100million in cash but I prefer to make shitposts on the crypto section of a dead anime-inspired troll forum because it's so le comfy. I never post proof though but if you don't believe me you are a newfag or a tourist as we like to say. I have over a 100 million but all I wanna do is shitpost in this forum and never provide evidence. You dont understand bro. You are newfaggot if you do not understand. 100 million is enough to do literally anything in this world. 100million is enough to pay an army to shitpost for me while i'm getting my dick sucked by a new 18yr old instagram model every single day.
