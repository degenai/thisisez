They're fast and tough individually but absolutely brutal in packs, they reproduce very quickly, and they can dig underground and emerge anywhere very, very rapidly.

I feel like Indians (and to be clear, Indians means Indians, Pakis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshi, etc - all the same creature) are our world's Tunnelers. A festering problem we ignored for far too long, evolving in circumstances which made them antithetical to all civilized culture, and now so ubiquitous that there is no hope to prevent them from outbreeding and subsuming all other races and cultures.

Just as the real connection to a website is not the URL but the IP address, the real connection to a security for the settlement system that underpins global finance is the CUSIP number. \n\n<span class=\"quote\">>CUSIP-6 for BBBY/OSTK </span>\n690370\n<span class=\"quote\">>CUSIP for BBBY/OSTK shares</span>\n690370106\n<span class=\"quote\">>CUSIP-6 for 20230930-DK-Butterfly</span>\n075896\n<span class=\"quote\">>CUSIP for cancelled shares of 20230930-DK-Butterfly</span>\n075896100\n<span class=\"quote\">>CUSIP for BBBY-WT warrants issued by BBBY/OSTK</span>\n075896159\n\nAs you can see, the CUSIP-6 for BBBY-WT proves that BBBY/OSTK and BBBY/20230930-DK-Butterfly are in the process of a merger. The value of the merger is in the ~$1.7B in NOL carry forwards which will reduce the tax burden up to 80% per year until depleted. \n\nPaid stock bashers hired by the people who shorted BBBY/20230930-DK-Butterfly into bankruptcy have infested every online space where the subject is discussed because all of those shorts will be realized upon completion of the merger.\n\nNow while the shares of 20230930-DK-Butterfly have been cancelled, the interests formerly represented by those cancelled shares can be issued new shares in the post-merger entity. Indeed cancelling shares is a routine part of every merger. For example. BBBY/OSTK just announced a merger with TBHC (formerly Kirkland&#039;s) under which the shares of TBHC will be cancelled and TBHC shareholders will receive 0.2 shares of BBBY for every share of TBHC.\n\nSo who cares? The trade is locked in, right? Wrong. That&#039;s why the paid stock bashers are here. BBBY currently trades for ~$5.84 and BBBY-WT currently trades for ~$0.67.",

Third worlders will slowly buy into crypto as they get internet access, so we can expect a upward trend over time in bitcoin even after crash cycles. But the situation is similar to computer hardware, when the tech was new there was tons of diversity in products. The first consumers were discerning and picked their products based off a long checklist because they were auteurs of their hobby. Soon after as it became more mainstream the public settled mostly on Apple and Microsoft systems. There were guys back then at the time who thought the same as you, \"The new Commodore Amiga will surely make a breakthrough in the market with how advanced it is compared to the other products!\". And then nothing happened because 95% of the consumers were normies who didn't care and couldn't be swayed from their already help preferences. Stop hoping for a 10x in some altcoin, it's not going to happen. Buy and hold bitcoin like boomers do the S&P 500 and in 30 years you'll be fine. If that's not fast enough then rugpull some indians or something. Find a new investment other than crypto maybe, idk.
