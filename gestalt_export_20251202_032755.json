Blogposts claim that funding fees are necessary for \"price control\" but the prices are all set by oracles, not by traders, so that is nonsense. Anyway, the long and short of it (haha) is that the funding rate depends on the ratio of longs to shorts. If a lot of people are longing on your exchange, then they'll be paying you funding fees and you'll earn interest on your short. Since perps markets tend to be bullish, that means usually shorters get paid. But sometimes certain assets get shorted to all hell which means they'll be the ones paying. So it depends a bit on the pair you're trading",

They are completely out of touch with the entire crypto market. They peaked in 2018 in terms of following trends and learning about new projects. After 2018, they could only process link in their minds. Truly a fascinating phenomenon that should be studied by experts. Never has an investor married their bags to the point of obsession and building their identities around their investment more than stinkies. It\u2019s almost a unique case of Stockholm syndrome mixed with schizophrenia. When you bring up topics to stinkies such as \u201cbull run\u201d \u201ccrypto market\u201d etc their mind goes blank, they don\u2019t even process what you are saying. In their minds there is one thing and one thing only; Link and Sergei. Their warped minds will come up with endless grandiose scenarios to maintain their illusion that they are genius investors who are smarter than everyone else. They simultaneously hate and stick their noses up to normies, but also expect those same Normies to pump their bags and do all the work for them of making them finally make it.

    "gestalt_summary": "METANARRATIVE: The thread is gripped by a pervasive sense of impending financial collapse, triggered by rapidly rising Japanese bond yields and the unwinding of the Yen carry trade. This event is perceived as a catalyst exposing global economic vulnerabilities like US government insolvency and leading to a flight to perceived safe havens, particularly precious metals, while risk assets like crypto and stocks are expected to crash.",

    "top_quote": "Fed ending QT TODAY (Dec 1st). This basically means they're going to be adding a LOT of zeroes to their balance sheet, which is another way of saying they're printing trillions of more dollar shitcoins, which will dilute the dollar even more, and make assets more expensive. Meanwhile, central banks all around the world are dumping US treasuries, including the famous Yen carry trade now being over, which helped fund US government deficit operation. Basically, the United States government is insolvent because it spends more than it collects in taxes, and there's not enough buyers for their debt. Risk assets like Bitcoin which is correlated to the Nasdaq like 50% are going to be roadkill. Gold is literally the only safe haven remaining.",
