The biggest factors in your risk score by far (even more than ticket/accident history) are your credit score and automobile class (e.g. sports car), because your present credit score is significantly more correlated with your future accident rate than your driving history is, and most people that buy a sports car aren't doing so in order to cruise slowly around the local mall.
