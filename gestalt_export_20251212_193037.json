Like \"Hey, honey, look at WTF this guy was thinking of adding a 'great room' with a VIEW and 2nd kitchen and guest bath! Nice idea, would've never occurred to me.\"",

He lied about his education, and management found out three years after the fact, they argued to keep him on and certify him regardless of degree. Its not even that he was lying about CPA or anything which requires 150 credit hours minimum, but the cunts in HR let him go because he doesn't have a degree. So they hired this retard with a degree that I legit think had a mental deficiency and a non related art degree, who suddenly had a \"passion for numbers.\" I left that firm shortly after to join that dude at another firm.

Like \"Hey, honey, look at WTF this guy was thinking of adding a 'great room' with a VIEW and 2nd kitchen and guest bath! Nice idea, would've never occurred to me.\"",

All within my own wallet. Blockchains are like brokers, Bitchuds will choose to stay with their broker that only lets them buy one coin and nothing else, all because of \"Brand loyalty (lol)\". The average Eth chad has their ETH wrapped and on multiple chains across all bridges making gains regardless of bull or bear, I personally have some of my ETH on Solana as JLP (Jupiter Perps LP) +11% YTD and stables across multiple chains. Thanks to DeFi im actually beating the S&P dabbing on bitcoiners that think ETH is the only coin on ethereum -Eth user",
