So to have a bullrun you need: 1) New narratives that 2) People actually believe in, that 3) Launch at a low enough cap for early users to make money off. The current meta is just mass VC extraction events launching down-only stale narratives (another L1 lmao) at $10B FDV. No retail makes any money so there is no group of organic shills, so there is no momentum. Couple that with ever increasing retail skepticism as alts underperform year after year, and the result is that we will basically need literally useful, adopted apps launching at low caps before there's any chance of a bullrun again.",
