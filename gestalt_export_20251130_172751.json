I don't know about you guys but I don't think I can afford a physical price of silver. Ignore the shills. Fuck crypto and platinum/goldback SHILLS and pushers. Get fucked. This is not financial advice but KEEP ON STACKING. The Shanghai vault has less than 190 million ounces and is blowing through at a neck breaking pace. \"The Devil's money\" my dick. It is God's money. Jews are satan worshipping demons and their cathedral is the federal reserve. Their monument to Satan is the comex. They don't want you to own silver so tell them to fuck off. Not a SINGLE news outlet is talking about the deficit meanwhile this is a time to PANIC. In another thread people said silver will never hit triple digits, LMAO. IT IS ABOUT TO GO TO BEYOND EVEN THAT. Normies can barely afford to live let alone stack metal.

As such, the calculus informing this play was premised on a fairly logical assessment of his temperament and character. It makes pretty good sense to suppose that that the con job viz the trump coin would play out in stages. First, the immediate rug pull. Then a slow bleed down to low single digits; then, when all hope is lost, an explosive pamp followed by yet another epic rug pull while holders are told it\u2019s going into the thousands. That\u2019s still a plausible scenario. There again, the scenario outlined above is equally plausible. All in all, I would say the chances of his running a massive scam with one or the other of his coins (a scam involving a massive pamp, that is) are near 100%. You just have to guess which sham is the most viable. But, once you understand how the stock market works, the Trump coins are no different than any tech stock\u2026or any stock. The entire market is completely rigged and is a means to fleece the public. There is nothing you can trust in the United States in 2025. So, good luck to us all in guessing what assets Jews will use to affect their corrupt designs. What a shit world this is.",
